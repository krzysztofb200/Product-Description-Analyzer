## Project Status
Project is: _no longer being worked on_. It was my graduation project, so I stopped working on it after I finished it.


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- Using Firebase Firestore instead of Firebase Realtime Database would be better with this kind of app.


## Acknowledgements
